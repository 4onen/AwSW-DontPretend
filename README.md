# AwSW - Don't Pretend

This mod provides a proper, lore-friendly offramp for Maverick's distrust, to possibly lead into someone else's Maverick romance extension.

I am, however, not planning to do the romance part.

<details>
<summary>Current progress: (Here there be spoilers!)</summary>

- [x] Give the player less rude options for speaking with Maverick in the Chapter 1 investigation.

- [x] Give the player the option to talk to Bryce about Maverick during Bryce1, if they were less rude than canon in the Chapter 1 investigation.

- [x] Have Bryce pull Maverick aside, meet him back at the police station, and reinstate him.

- [x] Have reinstated Maverick confront you in broad daylight, as per Chapter 2 investigation.

- [ ] Have Maverick meet you on a "date" in Chapter 2 to interrogate you, then change his opinion about you as per Chapter 4 in Bryce's path (but early!)
